      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an EngD candidate at Griffon Marine, focusing on amphibious simulations for pilot training (Advisor: Prof. Jian Chang). My academic background includes an MPhys from the University of Manchester, where I researched two-dimensional materials for graphene spintronics (Advisor: Dr. Ivan Vera-Marun), and a year abroad at the University of Maryland College Park.
