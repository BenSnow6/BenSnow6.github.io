Intro We&amp;rsquo;re looking at lab 0 of the Serverless-ML course today. Make sure to check out their website and their Github repository and give them a star!
This course aims to allow a data scientist to deploy machine learning and predictive services online without the use of a server. This is useful in creating powerful business applications to show the predictive capabilities of a machine learning model quickly and effectively.</description></item><item><title>Serverless Machine Learning Module 1</title><link>https://BenSnow6.github.io/posts/serverlessml/lab-modules/lab-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://BenSnow6.github.io/posts/serverlessml/lab-modules/lab-1/</guid><description>05/10/2022
Lab 1 Serverless Machine Learning #machinelearning #course #hopsworks #serverless #gradio
We&amp;rsquo;re looking at lab 1 of the Serverless-ML course today. Make sure to check out their website and their Github repository and give them a star!
Introduction Following on from Module 0 labs we are now going to look into deploying an actual machine learning product to the web! How exciting! :D
We are going to investigate the notorious Iris dataset and create several models to predict the variety of flower given a set of characteristics about flowers.</description></item><item><title>Restructuring a project</title><link>https://BenSnow6.github.io/posts/restructuring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://BenSnow6.github.io/posts/restructuring/</guid><description>Introduction Jumping right in, let&amp;rsquo;s start by creating a new folder on the desktop, a new conda environment, and activate that environment.
mkdir ~/Desktop/DepthEstimation conda create --name depth_env conda activate depth_env I will be using the CookieCutter Data Science template to create a new project structure. This is done with the following commands:
pip install cookiecutter cookiecutter -c v1 https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science After filling in the CookieCutter template, we can navigate to the newly created project and start working on it.</description></item><item><title>Depth estimation project review</title><link>https://BenSnow6.github.io/posts/introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://BenSnow6.github.io/posts/introduction/</guid><description>Introduction Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to take a look at a computer vision project on depth estimation and see how we can improve it. The goals of this investigation are twofold
Highlight the good and bad practices used in the project Apply MLOps techniques to serve a production model in the cloud A few of the techniques to be included are the following: Unit testing, CI/CD, cloud serving, monitoring, and model experimentation and evaluation.</description></item></channel></rss>
