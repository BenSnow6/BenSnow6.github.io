# a summary about you
summary: 'I am an independent machine learning contractor who is passionate about computer vision and artificial intelligence.
During my EngD, I have gained research experience working with depth estimation models and denoising diffusion probabilistic modelling.
I am keenly interested in Machine learning, specifically in productionisation of machine learning from proof-of-concept
 research into usable, scalable business products. My experience as a research involved building a
  realistic [Hovercraft Training Simulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW1yrfLfIqA) from scratch in C++ with 
  the Unreal Engine for Griffon Hoverwork Ltd. I am currently looking for Outside IR35 contract work in machine learning and computer vision.
