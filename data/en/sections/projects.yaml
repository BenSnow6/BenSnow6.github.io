  summary: Do you save money, energy, time or risk? I am developing a Unity game in C# to understand the tradeoffs of these factors and more when it comes to drones being used for last-mile logistics.

  summary: Hovercraft are expensive, can't we make a simulator instead? I researched and developed a physics-based driving simulator for training hovercraft pilots for Griffon Hoverwork Ltd. to allow them to do exactly that!

  summary: Can we use heat and magnetism to speed up computers and save energy? In my MPhys research, I investigated the effects of magnetisation direction and temperature gradient on the resistivity of a 2D cobalt film on hBN and SiO2 substrates for graphene spintronics applications to find out if it's possible.

- name: Neutrinoless double Beta Decay and the theory behind the possible Majorana nature of the neutrino

  role: MPhys Researcher
  timeline: "Apr 2018 - May 2018"

  summary: The game, Mrs. Hudson, is on! The game here is the quest to find Neutrinoless Double Beta decay and show that neutrinos act as their own antiparticles. Here I derive from first principles the conservation laws surrounding Majorana particles from the Dirac equation and discuss their impact.
